# pathfinder

Tech Stack: Python, Pygame, NumPy.

Core Logic: Implemented a Q-Learning agent (Reinforcement Learning) capable of navigating dynamic environments.

Key Features: Developed a real-time environment where the agent learns to optimize paths by processing positive rewards (reaching goals) and negative penalties (hitting obstacles or walls).

Problem Solving: Managed the "Exploration vs. Exploitation" trade-off using an Epsilon-greedy strategy, allowing the agent to adapt its behavior as its memory (Q-Table) matures.

Other features not mentioned:
Moveable "player" character |
BFS pathfinding from player toggled by "enter" |
Map reset with space.
